# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!



"""""

I'd like to add a more useful function in future like sMaRT tEXt rEaDInG EmPOweRed with AI

But tbh its probably will be not in incoming few weeks

At the moment of March 16th I started to work on simple "Text Search System" (probably I'll do it after a short break, so i could make some progress in my course path)
It will be not just "finding words' (who need this?), but also tracker of the text, 
and can output more than 1 sentence, or even whole paragraph or topic if number of words that user looking for is more than % of coincidence in text that have even some sense
for topic that we are looking for or parsing (yeah that also algorithms, but I already imagined how it should work).


P.S.
I'd like to make an interface more interesting also.
